# Witticism Front-End

This is the front-end for a game that's inspired by party games like Quiplash and Cards Against Humanity. It is also inspired by my real-life suffering via a lack of social contact post-covid / gaming friends that have moved away! Jokes aside, the finished product would be able to be played remotely over your preferred video conferencing software. Also, believe it or not, Witticism *is* a real word.. I am not actually that clever.

Full README in angular folder. I cloned the repo before generating the project inside. Will fix later!
